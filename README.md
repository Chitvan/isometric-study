# isometric-study

I originally created this project as a solution to a specific interview question. But isometric views have caught my attention since then. The intention is to use this project to study them more. 

Current features: 
- Renders a pre-defined isometric grid view by parsing a JSON file
- Displays four types of tiles on grid
- Clicking on wooden tile places a table on it
- Table can only be places on 2x1 space
- Table aligns itself correctly based on horizontal or vertical space available
